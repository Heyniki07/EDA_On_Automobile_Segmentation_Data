EDA On Automobile Customer Segmentation Data

An automobile company plans to enter new markets with their existing products (P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5). After intensive market research, they’ve deduced that the behavior of the new market is similar to their existing one. In their current market, the sales team classified customers into 4 segments (A, B, C, D) and performed segmented outreach and communication accordingly.

## 🔍 Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following features:

- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Ever Married`
- `Graduated`
- `Profession`
- `Work Experience`
- `Spending Score`

## ⚙️ Operations Performed

### 1. Data Pre-processing
- Handled missing values.
- Encoded categorical features.
- Engineered new features (e.g., `Age_Group`, `Spending_Score_Encoded`).

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized distributions of numerical and categorical features.
- Used boxplots to analyze relationships (e.g., Age vs. Spending Score).
- Created correlation matrices.
- Analyzed customer distribution across segments.

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- Built classification models (Logistic Regression).
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- Identified important features influencing segmentation.
