# EDA_On_Automobile_Customer_Segmentation_Data
 Project Overview
EDA on Automobile Customer Segmentation Dataset aims to help an automobile company understand its customer base better before entering new markets. By leveraging historical customer data, the project performs segmentation and builds predictive models to guide targeted marketing strategies.

 Dataset Description
The dataset includes customer information such as:

*Gender

*Age

*Ever Married

*Graduated

*Profession

*Work Experience

*Spending Score

*Family Size

*Customer Segmentation Label (A, B, C, D)

Operations Performed
1. Data Pre-processing
Handled missing values and inconsistencies.

Converted categorical data to numerical format using encoding techniques.

Created additional features like age groups and encoded spending score.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution plots for numerical features.

Count plots and bar graphs for categorical variables.

Boxplots to visualize relationships between age and spending score.

Correlation matrix to find inter-feature relationships.

Segmentation-wise demographic and behavioral analysis.

3. Predictive Modeling
Built classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) to predict customer segments.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

Identified key features influencing customer segmentation.

 Objective
To segment customers effectively based on demographics and behavioral data to support personalized marketing and optimize the go-to-market strategy for new territories.
